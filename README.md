# data-generator
Python scripts to generate time series mocking the data of the concentrations of gases dissolved in a power transformer oil.
Normally includes timestamp and a sequence of concentrations: H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6.
Sequences simulate the development of a defect inside the transformer with occassional additions of data anomalies caused by the measurement device malfunction.
